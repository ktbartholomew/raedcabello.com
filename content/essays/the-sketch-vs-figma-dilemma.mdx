I distinctly remember how much hatred I had in my heart when I lived through my first UI update. The year was 2009; I had just gotten my braces off and I was ready to smash that ‘Like’ button on my high school crush’s status when I logged into Facebook the first time that week. I was devastated to find that something looked a miss. Text navigation was replaced with iconography, event reminders were further down on the page, and it was altogether unsettling. Who did this? 

I had just gotten comfortable navigating around the site like a pro, cultivating Farmville success like you wouldn’t believe while returning meaningless ‘Pokes’ at lightning speed. I knew that functionally, the site was the same, but it felt like my furniture had been completely rearranged while I wasn’t home.
Years down the line, I find myself sitting at the other end of the table, working as an Experience Designer, being the very change that I hated so much on that brace-less day. I’ve learned to appreciate the change and ~generally speaking~ improvements that I experience through the UI updates of my favorite applications. But it’s only human to be resistant to change.

**• Both tools are top of line.** If you’re new on the block and are coming to either of these tools for the first time, know that you have already made a good choice. Either tool is an absolute state-of-the-art prototyping software and no one would argue otherwise. Chances are, you’ll just like whatever feels most similar to the tools you come from!

**• Sketch runs on Mac OS only.** Figma is a browser-based application that also has Desktop Apps for Mac, and Windows. It sure sounds nice that Figma has 3+ options, but you probably only really need one. And if you’re a designer, chances are you live and die by your Macbook, so both options are a fit. Don’t let this be a deciding factor to you if you don’t plan on collaborating cross-platform. (However, do consider that being a web-based platform, Figma stores all of your design files in the cloud, freeing up space on your hard drive, and ensuring your most-up-to-date files are accessible from any machine with an internet browser.
