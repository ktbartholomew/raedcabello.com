I’m a graphic designer born and raised in San Antonio, Tejas.
I enjoying solving problems through heavy use of simplicity, typography, and whitespace with
a primary focus on content.

I have a strong interest in 45rpm records, particularly records produced in the 50’s/60’s and recorded in San Antonio. I currently work with 3-time Grammy nominated Chicago based record label Numero Group on releasing some of these archival recordings.

If you’re interested in working together or just wanna grab some coffee, [drop me a line]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/).<br/>
