This is the website for Rae Cabello, which lives at [https://www.raedcabello.com](https://www.raedcabello.com). It is a static site generated with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).


## Development

### Initial setup

You will need `node` and `npm` available in your terminal. You will need some kind of text editor (such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) to edit the site's files.

First, install the site's dependencies using `npm`:

```
npm install
```

This will take a while, as it downloads and unpacks everything.
